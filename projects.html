          <h4>Design and Implementation Of Finite State Machine For Washing Machine</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The automated washing machine can be modeled using a finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog HDL, which can be implemented on an FPGA.</li>
            <li>The FSM will have several states, including start, water_in ,Rotate and Water_out, with transitions between states triggered by various inputs such as start, stop.</li>
          </ul>
